    <h2><b>Cinema</b></h2>
        <p>My passion for the cinema started when I was a kid. Since I was a kid, my father introduced me into so many movies, and to me, it didn't matter the gender, normally I loved each one of </br>
        them. Then with the time, I started to watch movies also by myself, it just became an habit, to the point that now days I can easily watch one or two movies a day, it simply relaxes me.
        </p>
    <h2><b>Programming</b></h2>
        <p>I became interested about programming when I was a teeneager. I never had the chance to have a higher education such as an university career, since back in my home country the situation </br>
        is quite different than here in Finland. Now days, I have a chance to get into this world and make it to be my profesional career, so that's the reason why I'm studying here at JAMK.
        </p>
    <h2><b>Sport</b></h2>
        <p>When I was a kid I was passionate about football, I remember waiting desperedtly everyday for the school to be over so I could go and play football with my friends. In the present I still do </br>
        sport, but now is more related about my health state, such us running and weight lifting.But who knows, maybe I will give it a try and get into something like tennis or padel.
        </p>

    <h2><b>Video Games</b></h3>
        <p>I would lie if I wouln't say that video games are my main hobby, since they truly are. Basically everyday I play some videos in my free time, whenever I do not have something better to expend </br>
        it on. We could also say that video games are one of the reasons why I got so interested into programming; I feel quite confortable being on my computer, time can fly even when I'm studying on </br>
        practicing my skills with the different subjects of this course.
        </p>
    
    <h2><b>Languages</b></h2>
        <p>At last, languages. Back is my home country is quite rare to find people that would be interested into even learning the most useful language in the would, English. But I did care about it, and </br>
        I do not regreat my choice of studying it, since It opened so many doors in my life, that's mainly the reason why I ended up here in the north of Europe. I will always encourage people into learning </br>
        new languages, now I try to focus into finnish, which I have now a B1 level.
